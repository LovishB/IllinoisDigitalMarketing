Question 1
In what way can free, publicly available sources of structured data be used to aid your organization’s (or an organization of
your interest) marketing efforts?

We use google analytics data for fine tuning our marketing campaigns as well as improving brand awareness. We also use
socio-economic information from world bank and Fed to improve targeting and positioning. Finally we are using census information
for demographic targeting and segmentation. All these are either publicly available or free with registration and have provided
us with tremendous value in various marketing initiatives
