Question: Do you think the addition of ZMOT by Google in the 3-step model of marketing has made it better? If yes, why? If not,
why not?

The addition of ZMOT has definitely changed the way we look at marketing as a process. In that sense it has had a positive
impact on marketing. The aim of ZMOT is to explain how the consumer's research and decision-making journey on the way to
purchase is now fundamentally different. ZMOT is another way of looking at the marketing funnel. It has brought in the idea
that today's consumer performs the early stages of activity in the funnel in a different way now. The research process, the
sources and methods are much more complex today. Add to that the fact that mobile has become such a big part of the daily lives
of consumers.

Today's consumer moves across various channels seamlessly. They move across online, word of mouth and back online again. This is
unpredictable and is therefore important that brands attract consumers early in their decision cycle. This will give them the
opportunity to present the best case at a time when they are yet to decide on the final choice. The ZMOT has now stretched the
consumer journey in such a way that brands have another opportunity to be in front of the consumer.

ZMOT helps brands to guide the consumer on their journey and then monitor and measure the amount of attention and trust that
comes back as a result, finally linking it back to the sales. It has thus opened another window into the world of the consumer.
