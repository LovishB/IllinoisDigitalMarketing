Question: In one of the lectures, the instructor mentions that "No tool is ever as valuable as the analyst." Do you agree with
this statement? Explain your opinion by providing a reasonable argument along with one or two examples.

Yes i agree with the statement.

Tools today have provided with ways to collect, collate, analyze and present data. Today, with so much data floating around
within enterprises, it is important for someone to look at which data sources to tap into in order to come up with good analysis.
Here is where the importance of a good analyst comes into play. A good analyst alone can sift through the data sources and then
identify the right data set. This data set can then be fed into a tool to do various types of analysis. Once the data is
identified, it is important to see what kind of model makes sense for a particular problem. Only an analyst can make this
decision. An analyst will look at the business problem and then come up with the right kind of modelling technique to use.
Once the data is ready and the modelling technique identified, only then the tool can be of help. The tool as such cannot do
either of the two above.

Once the model is built and results are available, it is again the analyst who will have to make sense of the output. The tool
itself cannot recommend a course of action. The analyst using their past experience and domain understanding will decide which
is the best possible step to take based on the results of the analysis. This is vital, as same result could be interpreted in
different ways. Finally presenting the results in a way that is easy for users to understand is another thing that no tool can
do on its own. The analyst based on the audience, can come up with the right kind of visualizations and outputs that will make
the most impact.
