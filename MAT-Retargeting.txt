The article "New Ways Marketers Are Manipulating Data to Influence You" talks about retargeting, a new form of targeted
advertising that collects and analyzes personal information (such as credit card histories and web habits) to display
personalized ads to consumers. 

Question: Discuss whether you are personally in favor of the retargeting technique to achieve targeted ads. Explain the rationale
behind your opinion.

From the perspective of a marketing person, retargeting looks like a perfect way to get in front of the consumer with the right
product at the right time. This is especially true in today's day and age with all the micro targeting technology that is
available. The amount of data that consumers leave behind in the form of transactions, clicks, purchases, surveys etc is so
large that many brands can now focus very clearly on consumer needs. From that perspective it is something that have enhanced
the marketers tool kit significantly. The key here is to ensure that the right kind of data is used to target the right consumer.
Many a times, we are bombarded with ads which might look totally irrelevant to what we are looking for. There could also be times
when we might have looked at items out of curiosity rather than any intent to buy. These could be major turn offs for consumers
and their perception of the brand might change for ever. This is a drawback of having the volumes of data floating around. So
brands and marketers need to clearly pick up the early trigger points and specific intent to buy, so that they can then be sure
of the ads being presented is going to be useful for the consumer as well as profitable for the brands.

Looking from the perspective of the consumer though, there are serious privacy concerns, which needs to be addresses in a
holistic manner. Consumers should be given the choice to opt out of communications and also provide clear indication that data
submitted through forms and other means are not shared around
