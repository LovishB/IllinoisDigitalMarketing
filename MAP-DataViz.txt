Question 1
Describe one or two instances of data visualization that violate one or more of the 3 simple rules to visualizing insights with
impact.

Of the visualizations that i have come across the biggest issue i have is with bubble charts. In these situations, the analyst
will use the size of the bubble to signify value. But in most cases the bubbles are not scaled properly, resulting in similar
sized bubbles, but representing vastly differing values. This violates the contrast and sometimes the color aspect of
visualizations

I have also come across the use of treemaps. This is a bad choice when it would have been better to use a bar graph and allowed
comparison of the lengths of bars that have a common baseline. Furthermore, many times the arrangement of the rectangles is
arbitrary and are not specifically based on category or on the sizes of values.
